# PRODIGY_CS_05 – Network Packet Analyzer 🌐

A Python-based packet sniffer that uses Scapy to capture live network traffic and display:
- Source and destination IPs
- Protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Packet payloads (optional)

All packets are saved to a `.pcap` file for further analysis in Wireshark.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Packet-level networking with Scapy
- TCP/IP protocol inspection
- How packet sniffers work

## 🚀 How to Run in Terminal
```bash
sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py
